If you want to run a command with `sudo` without being prompted for a password, you can configure sudo to allow your user to run that specific command without requiring a password. Keep in mind that this approach involves modifying system settings, so be cautious and ensure that you understand the implications of what you're doing.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Type the following command to open the sudoers file in an editor. Make sure to replace `your_username` with your actual username:

   ```bash
   sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/your_username
   ```

3. This will open the sudoers file for your user in the editor. Add the following line to allow running your specific command without a password prompt:

   ```plaintext
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/your/command
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual username and `/path/to/your/command` with the actual path to the command you want to run.

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

Please note the following important considerations:

- **Security:** This approach reduces the security of your system, as it allows running a specific command as root without a password prompt. Be cautious and only use this for commands you trust and understand.

- **Syntax:** Be very careful with the syntax when editing the sudoers file. A mistake can lead to unintended consequences or even locking you out of your system. Always use `visudo` to edit the sudoers file, as it performs syntax checking before saving.

- **Specificity:** It's best to specify the exact command you want to run without a password prompt. This reduces the risk of accidentally running unintended commands as root.

- **Best Practice:** Whenever possible, avoid configuring passwordless sudo access. Instead, use `sudo` as intended to maintain the security of your system.
